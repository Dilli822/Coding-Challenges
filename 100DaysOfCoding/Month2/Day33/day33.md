Good day, everyone. I'm Dilli Hang Rai, participating in the ITSNP X Askmitra 100-day challenge. I encourage everyone to begin their 100 days by learning anything they choose; it will be fun.
Day 33 of 100: Tags : #Clg_askmitra100days #Day33ofClg_askmitra
What have I learned today in ML?
Difference ML vs AI vs Neural Networks
Multi-layer of neurons --> neural networks, where a single  neuron is nothing but the w1 is the weight associated (strength of neuron) with input x1  ie. w1.x1
y=f(∑i=1n​(xi​⋅wi​)+b) where b is a bias 
ML is a subset of AI, data + answers = rules/algorithms, that produce predictions and results without being traditionaly programmed 
Although AI has no perfect definition to understand it simply it is a technique adopted by machines to mimic human behavior, intelligence, and reasoning problem-solving...
Neural Networks are inspired by the human biological brains
Feeding data is important
